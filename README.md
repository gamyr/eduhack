## Inspiration

We found that in school writing courses, the structure of learning is that you get a project, you complete it, and then you get a grade. This is usually not conducive to learning because it does not allow the student to get feedback on what to improve along the way. We wanted to make an application that could allow students to receive feedback in real time while they work. This application also allows students to learn by themselves, by getting a prompt, writing off of it, and receiving feedback. This can be used alongside a classroom so that students can learn writing better and also get better grades.


## What it does

Our application consists of 3 parts - a prompt generator, a simple writing editor, and feedback provider. The prompt generator creates writing prompts for any topic and a variety of writing types with AI, the writing editor provides a simple way to write and download your writing, and the feedback provider also uses AI to give feedback to any kind of writing.

## What's next for EssayWay

We plan to add a better text editor that can save within browser, and possibly tools to help teacher with their classroom using this application.
